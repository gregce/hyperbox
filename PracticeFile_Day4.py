# Continue to Reacquaint with basic python functionality.
# Review common concepts to ensure familiarity. Learn some new concepts for the list.sort() operator.


#It's most common to pass a list into the sorted() function, but in fact it can take as input any sort of iterable collection. The older list.sort() 
#method is an alternative detailed below. The sorted() function seems easier to use compared to sort(), so I recommend using sorted().
#
#The sorted() function can be customized though optional arguments. The sorted() optional argument reverse=True, e.g. sorted(list, reverse=True), makes it sort backwards.
